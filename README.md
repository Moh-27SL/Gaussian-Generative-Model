# Gaussian-Generative-Model
This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of a Gaussian Generative Model for classification, developed from scratch as part of Assignment 3.  The objective is to understand probabilistic generative classifiers, parameter estimation, regularization, and model evaluation using standard classification metrics.
